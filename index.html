        As an aspiring MERN Stack Developer, I am constantly working on projects and building my skills in React,
        Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. Currently in my pre-final year at VIT Bhopal, I am pursuing a B.Tech in ECE
        with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics, which has equipped me with a strong foundation
        in programming and technical knowledge. In addition to my academic background, I have also completed relevant
        certifications in React and Node.js, demonstrating my proficiency in these technologies. To showcase my
        technical skills and creativity, I have built a personal website where I feature my latest projects and blog
        posts about my experience as a MERN Stack Developer. Overall, I am passionate about programming and committed to
        constantly improving my skills to become a successful MERN Stack Developer.
