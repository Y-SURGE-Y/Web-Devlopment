## Introduction

JavaScript is a powerful language that is widely used in web development. This course covers a wide range of topics, including variables, data types, functions, conditional statements, loops, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, and more.

This repository contains code examples and projects that demonstrate these concepts. By working through these exercises, I hope to gain a better understanding of JavaScript and improve my skills as a developer.
